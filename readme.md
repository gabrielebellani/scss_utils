# Scss Utils (Mixins & Classes)
This is a collection of useful mixins and classes for scss projects.
It's _**framework independent**_ and can be used in any project even without the need of JavaScript.

### Requirements
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

### Usage

If you just need to use the mixins, import them in your scss file like below or use ``@use`` for better performance:
```scss
@import '_mixins.scss';
```

If you need to use also the **classes**, feel free to skip ``_mixins.scss`` and directly import the classes in your scss file like below or use ``@use`` for better performance:
```scss
@import 'base-classes/classes.scss';
```

### Contributing

#### Roadmap

- [ ] Add more documentation
- [ ] Add SASS support
